First, you will need to gather a dataset of photos that are already appropriately labeled and tagged. This dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to recognize different objects and scenes in photos.

Next, you will need to choose a machine learning library and a suitable machine learning model for the task. There are many options available, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. You will need to decide which one is best suited for your needs based on the complexity of the task, the amount of data you have available, and any other constraints you may have.

Once you have chosen your machine learning library and model, you will need to preprocess your dataset and split it into training and testing sets. This will involve things like resizing the photos, converting them to a suitable format, and possibly applying some basic transformations to the data to make it more suitable for training.

Next, you will need to train your machine learning model on the training set. This will involve feeding the model the images and their corresponding labels, and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted labels and the true labels.

After the model has been trained, you can use it to predict the labels for the photos in the test set. This will give you an idea of how well the model is performing on unseen data.

Finally, you can use the trained model to predict the labels for new photos that you want to rename and tag. You can then use these predictions to rename the photos and add the appropriate tags.

Provide a list of new photos that you want to rename and tag. You can do this by replacing the [ ... ] placeholder in the following line of code with a list of file paths to the photos:
